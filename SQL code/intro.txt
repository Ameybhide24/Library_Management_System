The topic for our mini project is library management system.
The main purpose of this system is to provide automation to the
library.This system will be used for monitoring and controlling
transactions in a library.We have done the backend programming 
using java and have used the MySQL database.
For the frontend part,we have used java swing.

We have taken two types of user for this system.the root user
and lib_member user.When a librarian logins from his account,
a connection with root user will be established and when a 
Member logins from his account a connection with lib_member
will be established.The root user will have access to all
the database while we have granted only necessary privileges
to the lib_member user using GRANT command.
 
After logging into his account,Member
will be able to search the record of books and retrieve the 
details of books available in the library.
The system will be able to issue the
books to the members and maintain their records and can also
check which books are issued by which members.Also,the 
system maintains the late penalty of members who returns the 
issued books after the due date.Also the librarian will be able
to see the history of each and every transaction.
If the member doesn't have an account he will be able to 
register for his account.

We have used a function to check if a user is existing in a
table or not,procedure to calculate penalty and a trigger to
store each and every transaction in the history table.
Now rajat will explain the trigger in detail.
